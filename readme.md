This website is a generic seattle taxi site. Since the rise of Uber, Lyft etc taxi lost serious business and is now next to dead within the city of Seattle. 
However, I also believe a part of taxi downfall was it's inability to keep up with the times. Many of the taxi websites and apps have an outdated, unattractive UI. 
Inspired by the Yellow Cab site and the Uber site, I decided to design and create a generic taxi site.
